Task:
Therefore the app part is quite simple but there is a degree of problem solving in the task. What we are looking to create a simple one screen app which alerts the user that other Twitter users are near them should they be interested.

Therefore I would like to see a simple piece of code which takes the phones GPS position and current time. It should then search the Twitter Geo APIs for any tweets that match this rough location within 500m within a 30minute time span. Unfortunately twitter does not allow searching on lat/lon in all circumstances of tweets and photos and forces users to use placename ids.





1) We use the standard twitter api search for radius, and coords.

2) This will not return all because there will be tweets that have place rather than coords so....
user twitter geo api to get all the places within range. Filter out those that are large enough to include areas outside the range. Search on remaining places




Need a timer to look periodically for updates
Location change updates handled by the locationManager  - currently just works the once so no drain on battery

Results duplicates are filtered out.
Need to sort results on time / distance - plus futher filter to clean data

Need much more comprehensive error / exception handling required 

Need indicator for showing that new tweets are being delivered.

Need to display time of tweet and distance. (with places, use between 0 & max distance)
